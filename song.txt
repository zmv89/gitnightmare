You are the sun
You are the only one
My heart is blue
My heart is blue for you
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock & roll
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
You are the sun
You are the only one
You are so cool
You are so rock & roll
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
Be my, be my, be my little rock & roll queen
